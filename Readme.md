I really like this because it’s a solid introduction to new concepts for beginners, including some more HTML5 semantic tags. 

By building this HTML project, you can expect to improve your skills in the following areas:

- Working with lists: Creating ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists to display ingredients and steps.
- Styling lists: Changing list styles and using images as list items.
- Embedding images: Using images to make content more visually appealing.
- The CSS Box Model: Manipulating padding, borders, and margins to adjust layout.

If you’re still new to web development, this is a great way to level up your foundational skills.
